# Ogle et al.'s stochastic antecedent modelling (SAM) framework
#
# Port of Ogle's ANPP OpenBUGS example from Appendix 2. See Box 2 in
# the main text.
#
# This is the wrapper function: sets things up, calls the model script and
# does something with the result
#
# NB. This runs faster if we don't monitor mu, but instead reconstruct it
#     from the fitted alpha terms by sampling the posterior. That is obviously
#     a bit of a faff so leaving that for now ... but it is pretty slow once
#     we increase Nsamples ... so ...
